# Galaxy_v2

This is a project created by Sam Hollenbach as an independent research project at Macalester College.
This version has been ported over to Python to improve processing speed and will incorporate more accurate representations of Dark Matter, as well as visualization in 3 dimensions.

All simulation code is now ported from previous project

Simulation now supports 3D calculations and visualization and has NFW density profile approximations for Dark Matter
